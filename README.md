# Touch Sequencer
## Building  
* Open the XCode project, build release the release version, and open it.  
* The sequencer outputs OSC, so sound was rendered in Max for Live. Made this decision to allow control over other arbitrary timbres in the future. Also, it allowed me to focus my energy on making the playhead crossing over a node animation as satisfying as possible.  

## Usage, changing modes
* 'n': node mode. tap to create nodes
* 'p': playhead mode. swipe to create playheads
* 'c': chill mode. touches are ignored

## Future work  
* bpm synced metrnonomes
* better looking playheads
* nodes decay over time
* playheads decay over time
* pitch shift with arrow keys
